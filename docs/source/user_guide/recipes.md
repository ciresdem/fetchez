# 🗺️ Recipes

Instead of running long, complex CLI commands every time you want to build a dataset, `fetchez` allows you to define your entire workflow in a YAML file called a **Recipe**.

By treating your data pipelines as *Infrastructure as Code*, you ensure your data pulls are perfectly reproducible, auditable, sharable..

## How to Launch a Recipe
Recipes are written in standard YAML. To execute a recipe and start fetching data, simply pass the YAML file to the `fetchez` CLI:

```bash
fetchez recipes run recipes/my_archive_project.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can load and launch recipes directly within a Python driver script using the `fetchez.recipe` API:

```python
from fetchez.recipe import Recipe

# Load the engine with your recipe and launch
Recipe.from_file("recipes/my_archive_project.yaml").run()
```

```python
# run a recipe from the fetchez api
import fetchez

fetchez.run_recipe("my_recipe.yaml")
```


## Anatomy of a Recipe
A `fetchez` YAML configuration is broken down into specific operational blocks. Here is a generalized structure for a project that downloads Topography and Boundary data, unzips it, and audits the result:

### 1. **Project & Execution Metadata**
Defines what you are building and how much compute power to use.

```yaml
project:
  name: "Miami_Coastal_Data"
  description: "Pulling raw shapefiles and TIFFs for local analysis."

execution:
  threads: 4 # Number of parallel download streams

region: [-80.5, -80.0, 25.5, 26.0] # The bounding box: [West, East, South, North]
region_srs: EPSG:4326 # The srs of the bounding box
```

### 2. **Modules** (The Data Sources)
The `modules` block lists the data sources `fetchez` will query and ingest. Modules are evaluated in order.

```yaml
modules:
  # Download NOAA Nautical Charts
  - module: charts
    hooks:
      # These hooks ONLY apply to charts data
      - name: unzip
        args:
          remove: true # Delete the .zip after extracting

  # Download Copernicus Topography
  - module: copernicus
    args:
      datatype: "1" # COP-30
    hooks:
      - name: checksum
        args:
          algo: "sha256"

  # Seamlessly include local data in the pipeline!
  - module: local_fs
    args:
      path: "../local_surveys/field_notes/"
      ext: ".csv"
```

### 3. **Global Hooks** (The Assembly Line)
The `global_hooks` block defines the processing pipeline. While module hooks only touch specific data, Global Hooks process the combined pool of data from all modules.

```yaml
global_hooks:
  # Runs after ALL downloads and unzipping are finished
  - name: audit
    args:
      file: "miami_data_audit.json"
```

#### Understanding Hooks and the Lifecycle
Hooks are the specialized tools that intercept and process your data. It is critical to understand when they run. `fetchez` processes hooks in three distinct stages:

* **PRE/MANIFEST Stage:** Runs before downloads begin.
  *Use case:* Filtering the list of URLs based on regex, limiting the maximum number of files to download, or authenticating tokens.

* **FILE Stage:** Runs during the download loop on each individual file.
  *Use case:* Unzipping archives immediately as they arrive, verifying checksums, or piping the file path to standard output.

* **STREAM Stage:** Runs after the FILE Stage having invoked the `stream-init` hook.

* **POST/COLLECTION Stage:** Runs after all files have been downloaded and processed.
  *Use case:* Generating a JSON audit log, zipping the final output directory into a clean tarball, or sending a Slack notification that the job is done.

#### Global vs. Module Hooks

* **Module Hooks** (`modules.hooks`): Only execute on the files fetched by that specific module. For example, you might only want to run the unzip hook on USGS data, but leave Copernicus files as tarballs.

* **Global Hooks** (`global_hooks`): Execute on the entire, aggregated dataset from all modules simultaneously.

## Advanced Execution: Placeholders, Modifiers and Schemas

Fetchez provides advanced tools to alter and validate your recipes at runtime without modifying the underlying YAML files.

### Runtime Context Placeholders
Fetchez automatically injects runtime variables into your YAML configuration using `%placeholder%` syntax.

**Important YAML Formatting Note:** To ensure your YAML parses correctly, you must enclose any string containing a placeholder in quotes (e.g., `"%shared_cache%"`).

Available placeholders include:
* **`%name%`**: The project name defined in the recipe.
* **`%batch_name%`**: The name of the current batch/tile being processed (or the formatted bounding box).
* **`%shared_cache%`**: The absolute path to the shared cache directory (falls back to the batch's tile directory if no cache is specified).
* **`%outdir%`**: The base output directory for the execution.
* **`%tile_dir%`**: The specific working directory for the current batch iteration.
* **`%region_srs%`**: The spatial reference system (CRS) of the target region.

**Example Usage:**

```yaml
modules:
  - module: tnm
    args:
      - outdir: "%tile_dir%"
    hooks: stream_reproject
      args:
        cache_dir: "%shared_cache%"
global_hooks:
  - name: multi_stack
    args:
      output: "%name%_%batch_name%_stack.tif"
```

### Modifiers
Fetchez includes a **Modifier Engine** in its `ModifierRegistry` that can automatically mutate your YAML recipes as they are loaded, allowing for complete runtime control of the pipeline.

#### Using a Modifier

Add a `modifiers` argument to the top of your YAML recipe:

```yaml
---
project:
  name: "My_Project"

modifiers:
  - name: exclude_module
    args:
      modules: margrav/charts
region: [-120.0, -119.75, 33.0, 33.25]
modules:
  - bundle: my-bathymetry-bundle
```

*What happens under the hood?*

By specifying the modifier: `exclude_module`, the engine intercepts your recipe and removes the named `margrav` and `charts` modules from the module Bundle `my-bathymetry-bundle`. Modifiers take an input recipe config and do something to or with it and return the possibly mutated bundle, right before sending to the core Fetchez engine for processing.


**Use the modifier in the cli**

```bash
fetchez recipes run my_project.yaml --modifier exclude_module:modules=margrav/charts
```

### Schemas
Fetchez includes a **Schema Engine** in its `SchemaRegistry` that automatically scans your YAML recipes to enforce rules or otherwise validate the recipe structure or purpose.

#### Using a Schema

Add a `schemas` argument to the top of your YAML recipe, in this example we'll use a theoretical `schema` that would make sure the `region` parameter is a strict 1/4 degree tile:

```yaml
project:
  name: "My_Strict_Project"

schemas:
  - name: "quarter-degree-tile"
region: [-120.0, -119.75, 33.0, 33.25] # Your exact delivery tile
```

*What happens under the hood?*

By specifying schema: `quarter-degree-tile`, the engine intercepts your recipe and checks your region to make sure it snaps directly to a quarter degree tile in WGS84. It will return the validity of the recipe based on that schema along with any errors it found.

**Use the schema in the CLI**

```bash
fetchez recipes run -R -120/-119.75/33/33.25 --schema quarter-degree-tile my_strict_project.yaml
```

## Extending Recipes (Plugins and Extensions)
Fetchez is generic. If you are building a custom tool (like a specialized DEM engine), you can register your own recipes, modifiers and schems either in your project or in the `~/.fetchez` configuration directory and they will be discoverable with the `fetchez.registry`

In your project, make a directory called 'recipes'; add any YAML recipes to that directory, add any python source files in 'recipes/modifiers' or 'recipe/schemas' and register them with `fetchez` in your `pyproject.toml`:

**Recipes**

```toml
[project.entry-points."fetchez.recipes"]
my_project_recipes = "my_project.recipes"
```

**Modifiers**

```toml
[project.entry-points."fetchez.recipes.modifiers"]
my_project_modifiers = "my_project.recipes.modifiers"
```

**Schemas**

```toml
[project.entry-points."fetchez.recipes.schemas"]
my_project_schemas = "my_project.recipes.schemas"
```
